## Version 1.2.1

**Released:** February 1, 2026

### Changed

- **Panel – Order Information card:** Removed Time Zone from the Order Information card (time zone remains in Account Details).
- **Panel – Live updates:** Main page and account details page now refresh data every 15 seconds without requiring a page reload (Status, API Connection, order info, driver ETA, etc. update in place).

### Added

- **Panel – Hamburger menu (mobile):** On viewports 870px and below, a hamburger button appears in the panel header. Tapping it opens Home Assistant’s main sidebar so users can access navigation and settings without leaving the panel.
